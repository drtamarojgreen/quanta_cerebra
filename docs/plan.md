# QuantaCerebra Strategic Improvement Plan

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the development and enhancement of the QuantaCerebra project. The plan is divided into four distinct phases, each focusing on a specific area of improvement.

---

## Phase 1: Enhanced Modeling

This phase focuses on improving the core data modeling capabilities of the simulation.

-   [ ] **Hierarchical Brain Region Support**: Implement support for nested subregions to create more detailed and accurate brain models.
-   [ ] **Temporal Smoothing and Decay Models**: Introduce models for temporal smoothing and activity decay to create more realistic animations.
-   [ ] **Real-time Data Stream Processing**: Adapt the application to process real-time data streams instead of static files.
-   [ ] **Configuration File Support**: Allow users to configure simulation parameters through an external file.

## Phase 2: Advanced Visualization

This phase aims to enhance the visual output of the application.

-   [ ] **Grid/Matrix Brain Map Layouts**: Develop new layout options for visualizing brain regions, such as a 2D grid or matrix.
-   [ ] **ANSI Color-Coded Terminal Output**: Add support for ANSI escape codes to introduce color into the terminal output.
-   [ ] **Export Capabilities**: Implement functionality to export visualizations as images (e.g., PNG/JPEG) without adding external library dependencies.
-   [ ] **Interactive Visualization Controls**: Add controls to pause, rewind, and step through the visualization in real-time.

## Phase 3: AI Integration

This phase will explore the integration of AI and machine learning models to enhance the visualization capabilities.

-   [ ] **Frame Interpolation**: Use models like RIFE or FILM for smoother frame blending and animation.
-   [ ] **Dynamic Panning**: Implement Ken Burns-style dynamic panning effects for ASCII animations.
-   [ ] **GAN Integration**: Explore the use of StyleGAN or VQGAN for generating more sophisticated and visually rich graphics.
-   [ ] **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**: Investigate the use of NeRF models like Instant-NGP for 3D rendering of the cortex.
-   [ ] **Diffusion Models**: Integrate state-of-the-art diffusion models such as VideoCrafter2, PixArt-Î±, or LCM for advanced video generation.

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Development

This final phase focuses on building a broader ecosystem around the QuantaCerebra project.

-   [ ] **LLM-Driven Input Generation**: Integrate with models like `llama.cpp` to generate brain activity data from natural language prompts.
-   [ ] **Natural Language Configuration Templating**: Allow users to configure the simulation using natural language templates.
-   [ ] **Feedback Loop Systems**: Develop systems that use feedback to adapt and evolve the visualizations over time.
-   [ ] **Plugin Architecture for Custom Renderers**: Create a plugin architecture that allows developers to add new custom renderers.
